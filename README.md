The error indicates that your script is failing to establish a connection with the TraCI server (Traffic Control Interface for SUMO). The primary issue lies in:

Port Unavailability: The default port (e.g., 63417, 63419) is either:

Already in use by another process.

Not properly configured in your SUMO simulation or Python script.

Server Termination: The TraCI server appears to have finished or terminated before your script could connect.

Potential Causes:

TraCI Server Mismanagement:

SUMO simulation ends prematurely, closing the TraCI server.

TraCI client (Python script) tries to connect after the server has already terminated.

Port Conflicts:

The specified port (63417 or 63419) is occupied by another application.

SUMO is trying to start on a random port but fails to connect consistently.

Improper Initialization:

The script may be attempting to connect to TraCI before the SUMO simulation is fully initialized.

Firewall or Network Issues:

Localhost communication via the specified port is being blocked.

Incorrect Configuration:

SUMO's configuration or command-line arguments may be incorrectly specified.

Steps to Correct the Error

1. Verify TraCI Server Initialization
   
Ensure SUMO is started correctly with the TraCI interface enabled. Use the --remote-port option to specify a consistent port for communication:

2. sumo -c your_config_file.sumocfg --remote-port 63417

3. Adjust Your Python Script
   
Ensure the script is correctly calling TraCI methods. Here's an example to manage server connections properly:
import traci

# Define SUMO command and port

sumo_cmd = ["sumo", "-c", "your_config_file.sumocfg", "--remote-port", "63417"]

try:
    # Start TraCI server
    traci.start(sumo_cmd)
    print("TraCI server started successfully.")

    # Connect to the TraCI server
    traci.connect(port=63417)
    print("Connected to TraCI server.")

    # Perform simulation steps
    while traci.simulation.getMinExpectedNumber() > 0:
        traci.simulationStep()
    
    # Close connection
    traci.close()
    print("TraCI connection closed successfully.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    traci.close()


3. Avoid Port Conflicts
   
If the specified port (63417) is occupied, try a different port:

sumo -c your_config_file.sumocfg --remote-port 63420

Match the port in your script:

traci.connect(port=63420)

4. Debug with Verbose Logging

Enable verbose logging in SUMO to get detailed information about the error:

sumo --log log.txt --verbose true

Check log.txt for additional insights.

5. Ensure SUMO is Running
   
Confirm SUMO and TraCI server are active:

Run SUMO manually using:

sumo-gui -c your_config_file.sumocfg --remote-port 63417

Then, execute your Python script.

6. Update SUMO and Dependencies
   
Ensure you're using the latest versions of:

SUMO

Python TraCI module (sumo-tools or sumolib)

Update TraCI dependencies with:

pip install sumolib traci --upgrade

8. Resolve Termination Issue
   
If SUMO is terminating early:

Check for configuration errors in your_config_file.sumocfg (e.g., incorrect file paths, missing networks).

Extend the simulation time or step count in the configuration file.


Final Checklist

Use consistent and available port numbers (e.g., 63420).

Ensure SUMO is started with TraCI enabled (--remote-port option).

Use traci.start() and traci.connect() properly in your Python script.

Avoid port conflicts by checking for running processes.

Debug and analyze SUMO logs for further insights.
